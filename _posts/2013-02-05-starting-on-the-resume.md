With my yearly review coming up at work, its about time that I update my resume, and I've been meaning to make a solid
HTML resum√© for quite a while now!

## The Plan

On a high level, these are the things I want:

- Single Page, only the important bits
- Write the content first with the structure that makes the most sense
- Add maybe a little Javascript (like a search through the 'buzzword' type stuff)
- Style it up with some bootstrap
- Add a print style sheet to make it paper friendly

Won't it be cool that maybe one day, the paper-friendly part will be a thing of the past!

Today (and the past couple days) I've been coordinating with TechITOutMN to give a presentation to some 7th and 8th graders
on why a career in technology is awesome.

First of all, careers in tech **are** awesome.

Secondly, opportunities to teach others, to broaden people's horizons, especially young adults just starting to find themselves
and become curious about the world, are **super** awesome!

Just like when I'd tutor for my neighbor's sons, I get really pumped at the opportunity to share the little knowledge I've
managed to obtain with young(er) people. I've been fortunate to have a lot of great people guide me along the way, and it feels
really really good to be able to give anything close to that.

I looked up whether the Twin Cities had a [CoderDojo](www.coderdojo.com), and sure enough [one is getting started](http://www.coderdojotc.org/)!
Emailed the guy heading the charge, hopeful to hear more! Just sounds like such a rewarding thing :)

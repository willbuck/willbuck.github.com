Started this a few weeks ago, but haven't been working hard enough to keep it going.

## The Game of Getting Better
I've decided that making my own self-improvement a game will help potentially keep me motivated.

They're very simple ideas at this point (more point-ification than an actual game), but it's a start anyway :)

Here are some of the ideas for my game

<ul>
    <li> Give points for certain activities
        <ul>
            <li> Smaller amounts of points for little wins, like doing anything at all on a given day</li>
            <li> Larger amounts of points for big milestone accomplishments, like finishing a set-about project</li>
            <li> Streak bonuses for doing things repeatedly or on consecutive days</li>
            <li> Other special bonuses as I see fit (Weekly Quests perhaps?)</li>
        </ul></li>
    <li> Exchange those points for little 'treats' for myself
        <ul>
            <li> Make each point worth X dollars into an account</li>
            <li> Use that money to buy toys</li>
            <li> Give myself a discount / multiplier if I spend the 'toy money' on things that benefit my self-improvement (e.g. Home Server, Wacom Tab)</li>
        </ul></li>
    <li> Continually use this blog to change the rules as I learn what works for me and what doesn't</li>
</ul>

I think this will make for a good activity to help me set goals and stay motivated.

### Points ideas for the last bit of January here (these are my goals)
- 2 points - Making styling commits / improvements to the blog
- 5 points - Writing a new blog post
- 20 points - Building the foundation of an HTML resume
- 25 points - Finishing a game at the Global Game Jam

#### BONUS
- 1 point per consecutive day making progress
- 5 points if every weekday charts progress

I will keep score in a Google Doc [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ArbFYinECBwHdHlGS004eUFLd1laMWJTOVZORVFGdVE)

I will likely bleed these into February as well, since I've gotten such a late start; Mostly I want to try and not be
too hard on myself, and just incremental progress.

                    Developed new website UI features, data structures, and backend web services for both consumer-facing
                    web application and internal web tools using MySQL, Groovy/Grails, and HTML/CSS/JS/JQuery.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Led a team of developers in designing year-over-year continuation data pattern for wellness
                    incentives from an original data pattern designed to support just one year, refactoring large amounts
                    of code to leverage new functionality
                </li>
                <li>
                    Worked closely with teammates to de-couple tightly knit consumer wellness program code from our
                    third party vendors, developing a generic solution that allowed integration with a new client’s self-administered program.

                    Participated in month-long R&D project to rapidly prototype native mobile applications, developing
                    REST services and integration points for a cross-platform deployment technology called Titanium,
                    a technology that allows one to write JS code and utilize custom UI frameworks to deploy native
                    applications to both iPhone and Android.

                <li>

                    consumer portal UI patches upon discovery of further requirements by product team, often having
                    only a day or even a matter of hours to quickly find a reliable solution and coming away with a
                    proven track record of success.

                    team members to develop practical skills questions and personally creating a HTML/CSS/Javascript
                    implementation question, eventually using the question to evaluate several candidates and gaining
                    valuable insight into applicants’ skills.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Worked late Wednesdays for three months in order to meet client deadlines on an entire UI re-write
                    of our consumer-facing application, working closely with manager to ensure events were catered and team morale stayed high.
